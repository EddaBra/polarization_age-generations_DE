**Abstract**  
In recent years, the extent to which the political values of younger and older people differ has been increasingly discussed in the media and in academic circles. The question of whether there is an intensifying generational conflict is becoming increasingly relevant against the backdrop of an ageing population. The indirect, mediating effect of generational affiliation and age on political preferences is examined by micro- and macro-sociological explanatory approaches. The current state of research provides a diffuse picture of whether and to what extent the polarization between old and young in Germany has changed over time. The aim of this research paper is therefore to use a descriptive analysis to describe the polarization in political attitudes between younger and older generations in Germany and thus provide starting points for further research.  
A hierarchical item response model is calculated on the basis of data from the General Population Surveys from 1991 to 2018, which estimates the mean values and variance for an older (“post-war and affluent generation”) and a younger cohort (“Generation X, Y and Z”). This makes it possible to identify patterns in the direction of change and convergence within the two groups in their political attitudes. Political attitudes are measured via four topics: Family image, morality, redistribution and migration. In a second step, Bhattacharyya's distance measurement is used to analyse how the polarization between the groups has changed over time.  
In a nutshell, it can be seen that the younger cohort is more left-liberal in their political attitudes than the older cohort. Furthermore, it can be seen that both generation groups have become more left-liberal and heterogeneous in their political attitudes over the years. The gap in political attitudes has remained relatively stable over time, meaning that there is no clear polarization or depolarization. If the individual topics are examined individually, it becomes clear that the differences in political attitudes between old and young are different and change to varying degrees: While old and young are very similar when it comes to socio-political attitudes, the difference is greatest when it comes to the image of the family. However, there is no strong polarization or depolarization in any of the topics.
